# PackageManufacturingDatabaseSystem
The packaging industry, despite being a part of the manufacturing process, is a service provider for clients. Consequently, every phase of the production process needs to be monitored in detail for quality control and improvement. Data such as inventory usage, production machine’s schedule, and types of orders are detrimental for the company’s performance. To achieve this, a complete and accurate database will ease the analysis that is required for the improvement and to gauge the manufacturing system’s performance. The database will be mainly used by the management team, Production planner, and quality control team.
